== DESCRIPTION:

Phuby wraps PHP in a loving embrace.  Exposes a PHP runtime in ruby

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* many

== SYNOPSIS:

  php = Phuby::Runtime.new
  php.start

  php.eval('$hello = "world"')
  assert_equal "world", php['hello']

  php.stop

== REQUIREMENTS:

* php

== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

* Download php-5.3.0

The following instructions apply to OS X (probably not needed on linux):

DO NOT change the prefix... No, I don't know why yet.

=== Install iconv with macports

  $ sudo port install libiconv

=== Install MySQL with macports

  $ sudo port install mysql5 mysql5-server

Set some symbolic links:

  $ cd /opt/local
  $ sudo ln -s /opt/local/include/mysql5/mysql /opt/local/include/mysql
  $ sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/mysql5/mysql/libmysqlclient.15.dylib \
      /opt/local/lib/libmysqlclient.dylib

=== Patch and configure php

If you're on OS X, apply php.patch to the downloaded php.  Then configure
php with the proper flags.  These paths are for OS X, but you should be able
to adjust them for linux:

  $ patch -p0 < ../path/to/php.patch

  $ ./configure --enable-debug \
      --enable-embed \
      --disable-cli  \
      --with-mysql=/opt/local \
      --with-mysqli=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysql_config \
      --with-mysql-sock=/opt/local/var/run/mysql5/mysqld.sock \
      --prefix=/usr/local

  $ make && sudo make install

Then, either install the gem, or rake test

== INSTALL:

* No.
